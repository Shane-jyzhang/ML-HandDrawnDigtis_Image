# ML-HandDrawnDigtis_Recognition

This is a project to recognise the hand drawn digits by using some ML methods  
Main code is in "LAB2.ipynb"

主要包括平衡数据、利用决策树方法进行模型训练，测试了不同深度下的决策树区别，可视化混淆矩阵。利用逻辑回归计算准确性。

It mainly includes balancing data, using the decision tree method for model training, testing the difference of decision trees at different depths, and visualizing the confusion matrix. Accuracy was calculated using logistic regression.
